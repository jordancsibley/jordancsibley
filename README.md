### What I'm up to 

I am a recent graduate of the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management where I pursued a Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS). I am passionate about using analytical tools to support scientific research and develop sustainable solutions for marine and coastal ecosystems.  

Currently, I am working as a Temporary Data Specialist for [Island Conservation](https://www.islandconservation.org/), a non-profit company that is focused on restoring islands for nature and people worldwide. In this role I am applying my data science skills to clean up real-world conservation metrics data to prepare for archival, as well as developing ways to streamline and organize their data management practices.
